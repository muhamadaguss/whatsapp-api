# 🧪 Phase 6: Testing & Refinement

**Status:** In Progress  
**Started:** October 11, 2025

---

## 📋 Overview

Phase 6 focuses on comprehensive testing of the SaaS transformation to ensure:
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation is secure
- ✅ Quota enforcement works correctly
- ✅ Performance is acceptable
- ✅ Security is robust
- ✅ All integrations function properly

---

## 🧪 Test Suites Created

### 1. **Multi-Tenant Isolation Tests** ✅
**File:** `tests/tenant-isolation.test.js`

**Tests Covered:**
- ✅ Authentication & JWT Token (organizationId in token)
- ✅ Data Isolation - Templates (scoped per org)
- ✅ Organization API Access Control (no cross-tenant access)
- ✅ Sequelize Hooks - Automatic Filtering
- ✅ Usage Tracking Isolation
- ✅ Cross-tenant access prevention (CRUD operations)

**Run:** `npm run test:isolation`

**Key Assertions:**
```javascript
- JWT includes organizationId for each user
- User 1 cannot see User 2's templates
- User 1 cannot access/modify/delete User 2's data
- Direct organization access blocked
- Sequelize automatically filters by organizationId
- Usage tracking independent per organization
```

---

### 2. **Quota Enforcement Tests** ✅
**File:** `tests/quota-enforcement.test.js`

**Tests Covered:**
- ✅ Quota Checking (retrieve current usage & limits)
- ✅ Soft Limits (warnings at 80% and 95%)
- ✅ Hard Limits (blocking at 100%)
- ✅ Template Quota (enforce creation limit)
- ✅ Grace Period (temporary overage allowed)
- ✅ Usage Reset (monthly reset functionality)

**Run:** `npm run test:quota`

**Key Assertions:**
```javascript
- Quotas retrieved with limit/used/remaining/percentage
- Warning status at 80% usage
- Critical status at 95% usage
- Exceeded status at 100% usage
- 403 error when sending message over quota
- Template creation blocked at limit
- Usage can be reset monthly
```

## 🚀 Running Tests

### **All Tests:**
```bash
npm test

## 📊 Test Results (Expected)

### **Multi-Tenant Isolation:**
```
🔒 Multi-Tenant Isolation Tests
  1. Authentication & JWT Token
    ✅ should login User 1 and receive JWT with organizationId
    ✅ should login User 2 and receive JWT with different organizationId
  
  2. Data Isolation - Templates
    ✅ should create template for Org 1
    ✅ should create template for Org 2
    ✅ should only see Org 1 templates when logged in as User 1
    ✅ should only see Org 2 templates when logged in as User 2
    ✅ should NOT allow Org 1 user to access Org 2 template directly
    ✅ should NOT allow Org 2 user to update Org 1 template
    ✅ should NOT allow Org 1 user to delete Org 2 template
  
  3. Organization API Access Control
    ✅ should get current organization for User 1
    ✅ should get current organization for User 2
    ✅ should NOT allow User 1 to access Org 2 directly
    ✅ should NOT allow User 2 to update Org 1
  
  4. Sequelize Hooks - Automatic Filtering
    ✅ should automatically filter queries by organizationId
    ✅ should count records correctly per organization
  
  5. Usage Tracking Isolation
    ✅ should track usage separately for each organization

  16 passing
```

### **Quota Enforcement:**
```
📊 Quota Enforcement Tests
  1. Quota Checking
    ✅ should retrieve current quotas and usage
    ✅ should check feature availability
  
  2. Soft Limits - Warnings
    ✅ should show warning at 80% usage
    ✅ should show critical warning at 95% usage
  
  3. Hard Limits - Blocking
    ✅ should block action at 100% usage
    ✅ should return 403 when sending message over quota
  
  4. Template Quota
    ✅ should enforce template limit
  
  5. Grace Period
    ✅ should allow grace period after quota exceeded
  
  6. Usage Reset
    ✅ should reset monthly usage

  9 passing
```

## 📞 Support & Issues

If tests fail:
1. Check database connection
2. Verify migrations ran successfully
3. Check seeders ran successfully
4. Verify .env configuration
5. Check server logs for errors

**Common Issues:**
- "Table doesn't exist" → Run migrations
- "Plan not found" → Run seeders
- "Connection refused" → Start database
- "Token invalid" → Check JWT_SECRET in .env
