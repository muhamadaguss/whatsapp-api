## 📋 DETAILED TASK SPECIFICATIONS

### ⚡ WEEK 1 - CRITICAL TASKS

---

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Safety Score Calculator

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Assignee:** GitHub Copilot  
**File:** `wa-flow-manager/src/utils/safetyScoreCalculator.ts`  
**Time:** 4 hours | **Completed:** Oct 4, 2025

**Description:**  
Create utility function to calculate campaign safety score based on configuration settings.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Function `calculateSafetyScore(config)` returns score 0-100
- [ ] Identifies 5+ risk factors (delay, daily limit, business hours, etc.)
- [ ] Returns warnings array with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Returns risk level: 'safe' (70-100), 'moderate' (40-69), 'dangerous' (0-39)
- [ ] Unit tests with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined

**Risk Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
Score starts at 100:
- Message delay < 15s: -20 points
- Daily limit > 300: -25 points
- Business hours disabled: -15 points
- Batch size > 100: -20 points
- No retry config: -10 points
```

**Implementation Notes:**
```typescript
interface SafetyScore {
  score: number;              // 0-100
  level: 'safe' | 'moderate' | 'dangerous';
  warnings: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

**Dependencies:** None  
**Testing:** Unit tests required before merge

>30 days (ESTABLISHED):
  dailyLimit: 150-300 messages
  messageDelay: 15-30 seconds
  restThreshold: 30 messages / 60 rest
```

**UI Design:**
```tsx
<div className="space-y-2">

```tsx
const RiskMonitor = ({ sessionId }) => {
  const [riskLevel, setRiskLevel] = useState('safe');
  const [factors, setFactors] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      const risk = calculateRealTimeRisk(stats);
      setRiskLevel(risk.level);
      setFactors(risk.factors);
    }, 10000); // Every 10 seconds
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, [sessionId]);
  
  return (
    <Card className={riskLevel === 'danger' ? 'border-red-500' : ''}>

**Assignee:** GitHub Copilot  
**File:** `wa-flow-manager/src/hooks/useAutoSafety.ts`  
**Time:** 4 hours | **Completed:** Oct 4, 2025

**Description:**  
Custom React hook that automatically pauses/stops campaigns when dangerous patterns detected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Auto-pause when failure rate > 30%
- [ ] Auto-pause on account disconnect
- [ ] Auto-slow-down when failure rate > 15%
- [ ] Toast notification with clear reason
- [ ] Log all auto-actions to database
- [ ] User can enable/disable auto-safety
- [ ] Manual override option

**Auto-Action Rules:**
```typescript
Failure rate > 30% → AUTO-PAUSE + alert
Failure rate > 15% → Increase delays by 50%
Account disconnected → AUTO-STOP
Consecutive failures > 15 → AUTO-PAUSE
Messages today > dailyLimit → AUTO-PAUSE for 24h
Connection quality "poor" → Slow down sending
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const useAutoSafety = (sessionId, stats, enabled = true) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!enabled) return;
    
    if (stats.failureRate > 0.3) {
      pauseCampaign(sessionId);
      toast.error("Auto-paused: High failure rate (>30%)");
    }
    
    if (stats.accountStatus === 'disconnected') {
      stopCampaign(sessionId);
      toast.error("Auto-stopped: Account disconnected");
    }
  }, [stats, enabled]);
};
```

**Dependencies:** Task 1.4 (Risk Monitor)  
**Testing:** Test auto-pause triggers with various scenarios
