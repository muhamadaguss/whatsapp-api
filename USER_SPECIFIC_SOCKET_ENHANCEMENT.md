# User-Specific Socket.IO Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This enhancement implements user-specific data isolation in the WhatsApp Blast Management System to ensure users only see their own data in the dashboard and receive targeted real-time updates.

## Key Modifications

### 1. Socket.IO Authentication (auth/socket.js)
- Added JWT authentication middleware for Socket.IO connections
- Implemented user-specific rooms (user_${userId})
- Token extraction from handshake.auth.token or Authorization header
- Automatic room joining on connection

### 2. Blast Control Controller Enhancement (controllers/blastControlController.js)
- Modified `emitSessionUpdate()` function to emit only to specific user rooms
- Added user isolation for all session operations:
  - createBlastSession: Emits to req.user.id only
  - startBlastSession: Emits to req.user.id only  
  - pauseBlastSession: Emits to req.user.id only
  - resumeBlastSession: Emits to req.user.id only
  - stopBlastSession: Emits to req.user.id only
- Maintained session ownership verification in all endpoints
- Enhanced notification emissions to target specific users

### 3. Blast Execution Service Enhancement (services/blastExecutionService.js)
- Updated `_emitSessionsUpdate()` function for user-specific targeting
- When sessionId provided: Gets userId from session and emits to that user's room only
- When no sessionId: Iterates through all users and emits to each user's room individually
- Ensures complete data separation between users

## Security Benefits
1. **Data Privacy**: Users can only see their own blast sessions
2. **Real-time Isolation**: Socket.IO updates are targeted to specific users
3. **Access Control**: Session ownership verification prevents unauthorized access
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Room-based approach supports multiple concurrent users

## Testing
A comprehensive test script `test-user-specific-blast-control.js` was created to verify:
- Multi-user session isolation
- Socket.IO room targeting
- Real-time update segregation
- Session ownership enforcement

## Frontend Integration Requirements
Frontend must be updated to:
1. Include JWT token in Socket.IO authentication
2. Handle user-specific connection lifecycle
3. Manage socket connections in AuthContext

This enhancement ensures complete user data isolation while maintaining real-time functionality and system performance.
